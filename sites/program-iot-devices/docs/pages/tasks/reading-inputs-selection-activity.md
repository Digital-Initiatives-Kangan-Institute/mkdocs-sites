## Task 1 — Pull-Up Button LED Using `if`

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    **Scenario:** A storeroom needs a simple indicator light that turns on for as long as a staff member holds down a wall button, and turns off the instant they let go.

    Your task is to program an ESP32-S3 to read a push button wired with the internal pull-up resistor and drive an LED to match.

    **Components:** ESP32-S3, push button, LED, resistor, jumper wires.

    **Wiring:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        ESP32["ESP32-S3"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO4 --- Button["Push Button"]
        Button --- GND1["GND"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO2 --- R["220 Ω Resistor"]
        R --- Anode["LED Anode (+)"]
        Anode --- Cathode["LED Cathode (−)"]
        Cathode --- GND2["GND"]
    ```

    Configure the button with `INPUT_PULLUP`. Read it every loop with `digitalRead()`. Use a single `if` statement (no `else`) to turn the LED on when pressed, and a second `if` to turn it off when released — practise reasoning about a condition with no `else` branch before Task 2 introduces one.

    **Check yourself:**
    - The button is configured with `INPUT_PULLUP`, not an external resistor
    - The LED is on only while the button is held down
    - Pressed reads `LOW` and this is reflected correctly in the condition

## Task 2 — Pull-Down Comparison Using `if / else`

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    **Scenario:** The same storeroom light now needs to be rebuilt using a pull-down button instead, so the electronics team can compare both wiring styles side by side.

    **Components:** ESP32-S3, button, LED, resistor, jumper wires.

    **Wiring:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        ESP32["ESP32-S3"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO4 --- Button["Push Button"]
        Button --- V33["3.3V"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO2 --- R["220 Ω Resistor"]
        R --- Anode["LED Anode (+)"]
        Anode --- Cathode["LED Cathode (−)"]
        Cathode --- GND["GND"]
    ```

    Configure the button with `INPUT_PULLDOWN`. This time use one `if / else` statement instead of two separate `if`s. Print `"Pressed"` or `"Released"` to the Serial Monitor from inside each branch.

    **Open this Wokwi simulation:** [https://wokwi.com/projects/472093662810633217](https://wokwi.com/projects/472093662810633217)

    **Check yourself:**
    - The button is configured with `INPUT_PULLDOWN`
    - Pressed reads `HIGH` (opposite of Task 1) and the condition matches
    - A single `if / else` replaces the two separate `if` statements from Task 1

## Task 3 — PIR Motion Alert Using Boolean Logic

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    **Scenario:** A warehouse wants a security buzzer that only sounds when motion is detected **and** it's currently after hours — motion during the day (staff walking around) shouldn't trigger anything.

    **Components:** ESP32-S3, PIR motion sensor, passive buzzer, jumper wires.

    **Wiring:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        ESP32["ESP32-S3"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO4 --- PIR["PIR Sensor"]
        ESP32 -- GPIO7 --- Buzzer["Buzzer (+)"]
    ```

    Declare `bool afterHours` near the top of your program and set it to `true` or `false` manually to simulate the time of day (no real clock needed). Read the PIR sensor every loop. Use `&&` so the buzzer only sounds when **both** motion is detected **and** `afterHours` is `true`.

    **Open this Wokwi simulation:** [https://wokwi.com/projects/472093910048097281](https://wokwi.com/projects/472093910048097281)

    **Check yourself:**
    - The buzzer only sounds when motion **and** `afterHours` are both true
    - Changing `afterHours` to `false` in code stops the buzzer even with motion present

??? note "Challenge — Click to expand"
    Add a `bool alarmEnabled` flag. Use `!alarmEnabled` so it correctly overrides everything else when the system is disabled — the buzzer must stay off no matter what motion or `afterHours` say.

## Task 4 — Potentiometer Dimmer With a Low-Brightness Warning

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    **Scenario:** A reading lamp should dim smoothly as a potentiometer knob is turned, but a small indicator LED should light up whenever the brightness is set so low it's barely useful, warning the user.

    **Components:** ESP32-S3, potentiometer, LED (dimmable), LED (warning indicator), resistors, jumper wires.

    **Wiring:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        ESP32["ESP32-S3"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO1 --- Pot["Potentiometer Wiper"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO9 --- R1["220 Ω Resistor"]
        R1 --- Anode1["Dimmable LED Anode (+)"]
        Anode1 --- Cathode1["Dimmable LED Cathode (−)"]
        Cathode1 --- GND1["GND"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO10 --- R2["220 Ω Resistor"]
        R2 --- Anode2["Warning LED Anode (+)"]
        Anode2 --- Cathode2["Warning LED Cathode (−)"]
        Cathode2 --- GND2["GND"]
    ```

    Read the potentiometer with `analogRead()` (0–4095) and convert it to a 0–255 range with `map()`. Drive the dimmable LED with `analogWrite()`. Use an `if / else` so the warning LED turns on whenever brightness is below 25, and off otherwise.

    **Open this Wokwi simulation:** [https://wokwi.com/projects/472094438850270209](https://wokwi.com/projects/472094438850270209)

    **Check yourself:**
    - The dimmable LED's brightness changes smoothly as the knob turns
    - `map()` correctly converts the 0–4095 reading into the 0–255 PWM range
    - The warning LED turns on only when brightness is below the threshold

## Task 5 — Comfort Monitor Using `if / else if / else`

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    **Scenario:** A greenhouse controller needs to classify the current temperature into one of three bands — Cold, Comfortable, or Hot — and show the result on the Serial Monitor, using a DHT22 sensor.

    **Components:** ESP32-S3, DHT22 sensor, resistor, jumper wires.

    **Wiring:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        ESP32["ESP32-S3"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO2 --- DATA["DHT22 DATA"]
        DATA --- R["10 kΩ Resistor"]
        R --- V33["3.3V"]
    ```

    Read the temperature each loop with the DHT library (read no more than once every 2 seconds). Use `if / else if / else`, checking the **most specific/narrow condition first**: below 15 °C → `"Cold"`; 15–29 °C → `"Comfortable"`; 30 °C and above → `"Hot"`. Handle a failed read (`isnan()`) before the temperature check, as shown in the resource notes.

    **Open this Wokwi simulation:** [https://wokwi.com/projects/471760934303645697](https://wokwi.com/projects/471760934303645697)

    **Check yourself:**
    - A failed sensor read is detected with `isnan()` before the temperature is classified
    - Exactly one of the three labels prints per reading, never more than one
    - Conditions are ordered so a later, broader condition can't accidentally catch a case meant for an earlier one

## Task 6 — Nested `if` Arm/Disarm System

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    **Scenario:** A small security system should only watch for motion while "armed." A single push button toggles the system between armed and disarmed each time it's pressed once (not held).

    **Components:** ESP32-S3, push button, PIR sensor, passive buzzer, jumper wires.

    **Wiring:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        ESP32["ESP32-S3"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO4 --- Button["Push Button"]
        Button --- GND["GND"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO5 --- PIR["PIR Sensor (OUT)"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO7 --- Buzzer["Buzzer (+)"]
    ```

    Track `lastButtonState` so you can detect the *edge* of a press (see the resource notes) rather than reacting every loop the button is held down. When a fresh press is confirmed, flip a `bool systemArmed` flag. Nest your logic: only read and react to the PIR sensor **inside** the block where `systemArmed` is `true`; sound the buzzer while motion is detected within that nested block, and make sure the buzzer is stopped whenever the system is disarmed.

    **Open this Wokwi simulation:** [https://wokwi.com/projects/471661119539001345](https://wokwi.com/projects/471661119539001345)

    **Check yourself:**
    - One press toggles the armed state once — holding the button doesn't rapidly toggle it
    - The PIR sensor is only checked when `systemArmed` is `true` (nested inside that condition)
    - The buzzer stops immediately when the system is disarmed, even mid-alarm

## Task 7 — Spot-the-Bug Worksheet (Extension)

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    For each round, read the snippet and write down what's wrong **before** revealing the answer.

**Round 1:**

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN);

  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
    Serial.println("Button pressed");
  }
}
```

??? hint "Answer — Click to expand"
    With `INPUT_PULLUP`, a press reads `LOW`, not `HIGH` — the condition has the logic backwards, so the LED lights when the button is released instead of pressed.

**Round 2:**

```cpp
void loop() {
  int potValue = analogRead(potPin);
  int brightness = map(potValue, 0, 255, 0, 4095);
  analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
}
```

??? hint "Answer — Click to expand"
    The `map()` arguments are reversed — the potentiometer reading is 0–4095 and needs to map *into* 0–255 for `analogWrite()`. It should be `map(potValue, 0, 4095, 0, 255)`.

**Round 3:**

```cpp
void loop() {
  int motionDetected = digitalRead(PIR_PIN);

  if (motionDetected = HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH);
  }
}
```

??? hint "Answer — Click to expand"
    `=` is assignment, not comparison — this always sets the condition true regardless of the sensor. It should be `if (motionDetected == HIGH)`.

**Round 4:**

```cpp
void loop() {
  float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
  float temperatureC = dht.readTemperature();

  Serial.print("Temp: ");
  Serial.println(temperatureC);

  delay(100);
}
```

??? hint "Answer — Click to expand"
    Two problems: there's no `isnan()` check for a failed read, and the DHT22 is polled every 100 ms — it can only be read reliably about once every 2 seconds, so this will frequently return stale or invalid data.

**Round 5:**

```cpp
void loop() {
  int redButton = digitalRead(redButtonPin);

  if (redButton == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(redLED, HIGH);
  } else if (redButton == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(greenLED, HIGH);
  }
}
```

??? hint "Answer — Click to expand"
    Both branches check the exact same condition (`redButton == LOW`) — the second, unreachable branch was meant to check a different variable, e.g. `greenButton == LOW`.

**Round 6:**

```cpp
bool systemArmed = false;

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(ARM_BUTTON_PIN);

  if (buttonState == LOW) {
    systemArmed = !systemArmed;
  }

  Serial.println(systemArmed);
  delay(10);
}
```

??? hint "Answer — Click to expand"
    There's no edge detection (no `lastButtonState` comparison) — while the button is held down, this toggles `systemArmed` on almost every single loop iteration (every ~10 ms), instead of once per physical press.

**Round 7:**

```cpp
void loop() {
  int motionDetected = digitalRead(PIR_PIN);
  bool afterHours = true;

  if (motionDetected == HIGH) {
    if (afterHours) {
    }
    digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH);
  }
}
```

??? hint "Answer — Click to expand"
    The nested `if (afterHours)` block is empty — `digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH)` sits outside it, so the buzzer fires on motion alone and `afterHours` has no effect at all. The buzzer line needs to move inside the nested block.

**Self-check:** How many did you spot correctly before looking?

## Task 8 — Smart Environment Monitor (Capstone)

!!! abstract "Instructions"
    **Scenario:** A community garden shed needs one combined monitoring system: it should only run its full logic while "armed" via a button, warn about unwanted humans after hours using the PIR sensor, warn about greenhouse conditions using the DHT22, and let a potentiometer act as a manual override for the alert buzzer's volume/duration via PWM-controlled intensity — bringing together every input type and every selection structure from this week.

    **Components:** ESP32-S3, push button, PIR sensor, DHT22 sensor with 10 kΩ resistor, potentiometer, passive buzzer, LED, resistors, jumper wires.

    **Wiring:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        ESP32["ESP32-S3"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO4 --- Button["Arm Button (+)"]
        Button --- GND1["GND"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO5 --- PIR["PIR Sensor (OUT)"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO6 --- DHT["DHT22 DATA"]
        DHT --- R1["10 kΩ Resistor"]
        R1 --- V33["3.3V"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO1 --- Pot["Potentiometer Wiper"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO7 --- Buzzer["Buzzer (+)"]

        ESP32 -- GPIO2 --- R2["220 Ω Resistor"]
        R2 --- Anode["Status LED Anode (+)"]
        Anode --- Cathode["Status LED Cathode (−)"]
        Cathode --- GND2["GND"]
    ```

    **Program requirements:**

    1. **Edge-detected toggle (nested `if`):** A single press of the arm button (debounced, edge-detected as in Task 6) flips `bool systemArmed`. The status LED should be on whenever `systemArmed` is `true`.
    2. **Nested `if` for motion:** Only when `systemArmed` is `true`, read the PIR sensor. Nest a second check inside: `if (motionDetected == HIGH && afterHours)` sounds the buzzer (use a `bool afterHours` flag set manually, as in Task 3).
    3. **`if / else if / else` for climate:** Read the DHT22 (no more than once every 2 seconds) and classify temperature as `"Cold"`, `"Comfortable"`, or `"Hot"` as in Task 5, printing the result and the humidity to Serial regardless of the armed state.
    4. **Potentiometer override:** Read the potentiometer and `map()` it to a 0–255 range. Use this value as the buzzer's PWM intensity (`analogWrite`) whenever the motion alert is active, so turning the knob controls how loud/intense the alert is.
    5. Handle a failed DHT22 read with `isnan()` before using its values in any condition.

    **Suggested sequence in `loop()`:**

    1. Check the arm button for a fresh press (edge detection) → toggle `systemArmed`, update the status LED.
    2. If `systemArmed`: read the PIR sensor; if motion **and** `afterHours`, read the potentiometer and drive the buzzer with `analogWrite()` at that intensity; otherwise keep the buzzer off.
    3. Independently of the armed state: read the DHT22, check for a failed read, then classify and print the temperature band and humidity.

    **Check yourself:**
    - The arm button toggles `systemArmed` once per physical press, not repeatedly while held
    - The PIR sensor and buzzer logic only run when `systemArmed` is `true` (nested correctly)
    - The buzzer only activates when motion **and** `afterHours` are both true
    - The potentiometer's mapped value visibly changes the buzzer's PWM intensity
    - The DHT22 read is guarded with `isnan()` and never polled faster than every 2 seconds
    - Temperature classification uses `if / else if / else` with conditions ordered correctly (narrowest first)

## Questions

Answer these in your own words before moving on:

1. Why does `INPUT_PULLUP` read `LOW` when pressed, while `INPUT_PULLDOWN` reads `HIGH` when pressed?
2. What's the practical difference between `if`, `if / else`, and `if / else if / else` in terms of how many branches can run per loop?
3. Why does `&&` require both conditions to be true, while `||` only needs one? Give a real-world example of each from this activity.
4. In Task 6/8, why is edge detection (comparing to `lastButtonState`) necessary instead of just checking `if (buttonState == LOW)` on its own?
5. Why must the most specific condition be checked first in an `if / else if / else` chain?
6. Why does the DHT22 need to be read with `millis()`-style timing instead of a short `delay()`, unlike a button or PIR sensor?
